## Abstract

Visual microscope identifications of fossil pollen are used to reconstruct paleoclimate and past changes in plant communities. Previous research has focused on computer vision models for classification. There are fewer protocols for pollen detection and image processing of a whole slide. Our three experiments address key issues in developing automated pollen analysis pipelines. We first address **detection bias** – missed detections of smaller, rarer pollen types. We fuse an expert model trained on this minority class with our general pollen detector and increased detection rates for small-grained taxa from 12 to 50%. We next addressed **domain gaps** – differences in image magnification and resolution across microscopes – and increased mean average precision from 32.56% to 64.55%. Lastly, we developed **continual learning** workflows that integrate expert feedback, that allow models trained on incomplete information
to improve over time. These methods are not only relevant to pollen analysis
but apply to other counts of visually diverse biological data.
